# Computational Intelligence

This repository contains the code and notebooks developed for the practical work of Computational Intelligence. The project was implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Repository Structure

- `module.py`: This file contains the auxiliary functions needed to develop each of the experiments, including:
  - Functions that implement the algorithms.
  - Functions that generate data.
  - Functions that calculate the error.
  - Functions that represent the target.

- Notebooks:
  - `perceptron.ipynb`: Contains the implementation and experiments with the Perceptron algorithm.
  - `regression_linear.ipynb`: Contains the implementation and experiments with the Linear Regression algorithm.
  - `regression_nonlinear.ipynb`: Contains the implementation and experiments with Nonlinear Data and tranformations.
  - `pocket_pla.ipynb`: Contains the implementation and experiments with the Pocket PLA (Perceptron Learning Algorithm).

## Requirements

To run the notebooks, make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter

You can install these packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter
```

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
cd repository
```

3. Start Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open one of the notebooks (`perceptron.ipynb`, `regression_linear.ipynb`, `regression_nonlinear.ipynb`, or `pocket_pla.ipynb`) and run the cells to view the experiments and results.
